//in java we can create a thread by extending Thread class or implementing Runnable interface
//Here we are implementing Runnable interface

/*public class Thread extends Object implements Runnable{
    public void run(){
        // The code that would fit at $PLACEHOLDER$ is:
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }

}
interface Runnable{
